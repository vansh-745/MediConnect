    "question": "What is diabetes?",
    "answer": "Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. When you eat, your body breaks down food into glucose (sugar). Your pancreas releases insulin, which helps cells use this glucose for energy. In diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it effectively, leading to high blood sugar levels. There are several types, including Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes."
